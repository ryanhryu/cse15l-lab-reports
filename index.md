Ryan Ryu - CSE 15L Lab1 Report

Hi everyone, this is Ryan and today I'm going to be talking about a few commands to use in terminal: cd, ls, and cat.
In this specific blog post, we're gonna be looking at this simple file structure

(pic)

cd (Change Directory) switches the current working direcetory to the given path
1) When it is used with no arguments,
   - it defaults to the root directory, which in this case is */home*
   - (pic)
   - As you can see in the picture, the working directory was /home/lecture1 when the command was run, but it defaulted to /home when cd was run without arguments
   - This is because when cd is used without arguments, it indicates to the terminal that it wants to redirect to home directory
   - Using cd without arguments do not generate an eroor. 
  
- path to directory as an argument
  -> screenshot of command & output
  -> working directory
  -> why I got this output
  -> if it's error/not, why/not
  
- path to file as an argumemt

  
<ls>

<cat>
